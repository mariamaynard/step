          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <div class="sub">
            <h3>Academic Interests</h3>
            <p>At this time, I am still experimenting so that I can find a concentration that I love. So far I have found that I enjoy web development and mobile development. 
                I am interested in doing a variety of internships so that I can get exposure to different things before deciding what I want to do as my career.</p>
            <p>Therefore I am interested in a variety of things including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Application development</li>
              <li>Web development</li>
              <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
              <li>Quantum computing</li>
              <li>Game design</li>
              <li>Program management</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="sub">
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <P>A big part of who a person is includes what they do in their spare time. Some of the things that I love to do are:</P>
            <ul>
              <li>Dance</li>
              <li>Paint</li>
              <li>Sing</li>
              <li>Bake</li>
              <li>Hike</li>
              <li>Camp</li>
              <li>Play video games</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Music and creativity have always been a big part of who I am. I stated dancing when I was three, and I haven't stopped. Even now being busy with school and work, I still find time to express myself even if it
                means taking a five minute break to dance around my room. I love crafts so every weekend I take time to paint. I also love nature, so I love to go outside and have fun doing things like hiking, camping, or kayaking.</p>
